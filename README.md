# work-day-planner
Welcome to my customized Work Day Planner Application!
This planner is designed to help the user keep track of their work day hour by hour. It is color coded by past, present, and future engagements. Past is shown as teal, the current hour is shown as white, and the future is shown as a golden yellow. *NOTE: the screenshots were taken after the end of the workday, but if you open the URL provided, it will demonstrate the color changes in real time*

Each time block row is an input field for the user to add notes.

Organization is key in the professional world so these notes are coded to save them locally into the browser so that if the user closes the browser and reloads it, their notes are still saved and display.
